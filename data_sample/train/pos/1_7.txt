if you like adult comedy cartoons, like south park, then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high. keisha, natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, i think keisha is a good leader. there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school. there's the idiotic principal, mr. bip, the nervous maths teacher and many others. the cast is also fantastic, lenny henry's gina yashere, eastenders chrissie watts, tracy-ann oberman, smack the pony's doon mackichan, dead ringers' mark perry and blunder's nina conti. i didn't know this came from canada, but it is very good. very good!
