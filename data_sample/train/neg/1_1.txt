robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. this movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. the script is unbelievable. the dialog is unbelievable. jane fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. the movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. it also plugs in every cliche in the book. swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review. when a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. avoid this movie.
