my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian.at first i didn't want to watch it, but i loved the movie- it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime.they portrayed the uscg very well, it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more.not only did it teach but it was a really good movie. the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is.i think being a uscg would be challenging and very scary. it was a great movie all around. i would suggest this movie for anyone to see.the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it. the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up. i cried it was very emotional, i would give it a 20 if i could!
